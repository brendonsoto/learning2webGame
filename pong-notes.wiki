= Pong =

Just created the repo.

Why Pong? Because it seems like the next logical step from Breakout.
It has all of the same properties with Breakout, but with an AI aspect.

== Gameplan ==
1. X - Create the base HTML
2. X - Create a ball
3. X - Create basic movement for the ball
4. X - Implement collision detection for the walls
5. X - Create a paddle for the user
6. X - Create movement for the paddle
7. X - Implement collision detection for the user paddle
8. X - Implement collision detection for the user wall to create the lose case
9. X - Create a paddle for the AI
10. X - Implement collision detection for the AI paddle
11. X - Implement collision detection for the AI wall to create a lose case
12. X - Implement AI
13. X - Add a score component
14. X - Display the score
15. X - Add sensitivity areas to the paddles
16. X - Add a score to win the game
17. Make a pause button
18. Create a start screen


For the AI, the original Pong game seems to have the normal mode AI simply move up if the ball is above its paddle and down if its below. Simple following maneuver.
