# Ball Bounce JS

A JS clone of pong.
I recently finished the [Breakout tutorial from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) and wanted to test myself by creating a Pong clone.

Why Pong? Because it is the most similar, yet different, game to Breakout.
